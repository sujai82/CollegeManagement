# College Management Portal (CMP)

> **One Campus. One Platform. Complete Management.**  
> An enterprise-grade academic administration platform built with React 19, Vite, Stitch UI Design System, Node.js Express, and Neon Remote PostgreSQL.

---

## 🏛️ System Overview

The **College Management Portal (CMP)** is a centralized higher-education management platform engineered for institutional governance, faculty workload administration, and student academic success. It centralizes student admissions, faculty workload distribution, department administration, lecture roll call with automated On-Duty (OD) credit calculation, live session PIN student self check-in, course enrollment, targeted campus notices, and role-based real-time analytics.

### Architecture Highlights
- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Stitch UI Design System (Deep Slate `#0b1c30`, Sky `#0284c7`, Emerald `#059669`, Neutral Slate `#eff4ff`), React Router v7, Axios, Material Symbols Outlined.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js REST API (`/api/v1`), JWT Authentication with cryptographically secure fallback, bcrypt password hashing, input sanitization, rate-limiting, and Helmet security headers.
- **Database:** Remote managed PostgreSQL on [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech) with SSL connection pooling (`pg`).
- **Zero BaaS Restriction:** Strictly no Firebase, no Supabase, and no local-only SQLite. Full relational schema integrity on remote PostgreSQL.
- **Persistence Guarantee:** 100% of data persists across browser reloads, frontend redeployments, and backend server restarts.

## 🚀 Key Features & Innovations

### 1. 🎓 Separate Role-Based Institutional Portals
Independent login gateways with role enforcement and tailored visual themes:
- **Student SIS Gateway:** [`/login/student`](http://localhost:5173/login/student) – Scholar transcript hub, course registration, attendance ledger, and live check-in.
- **Faculty & Instructor Portal:** [`/login/faculty`](http://localhost:5173/login/faculty) – Workload overview, class roll call, session PIN generation, and student advisement.
- **Admin & Registrar Hub:** [`/login/admin`](http://localhost:5173/login/admin) – Institutional governance, department control, faculty/student registration, and audit logs.

### 2. 🔢 Live Lecture Session PIN Check-In
- **Faculty PIN Generation:** Professors generate a dynamic 6-digit Session PIN (e.g., `485-568`) valid for 10 minutes, projected on the lecture hall display.
- **Instant Student Check-In:** Students enter the PIN on their **Student Dashboard** or **Attendance Log** to record their attendance.
- **Automated Verification:** The backend verifies student enrollment, session validity, and PIN expiration, recording attendance as `PRESENT` in Neon PostgreSQL with timestamped audit remarks.

### 3. 📝 Live Roll Call & Session Updates
- Faculty can take attendance period-by-period with bulk toggle actions (All Present, All Absent, On-Duty).
- **Session Submit & Update:** Automatically detects whether an attendance session already exists for the selected date and period, allowing faculty to submit new records or update previously submitted rosters.

### 4. 📚 Student Course Self-Enrollment
- Direct student enrollment at [`/enrollments`](http://localhost:5173/enrollments) with credit load limits and schedule conflict checks.
- Administrative and faculty oversight over student course registrations.

### 5. 🔮 "What-If" Attendance Forecaster Simulator
- Interactive simulator allowing students and advisors to forecast future attendance percentages.
- Calculates the exact number of consecutive classes a student must attend to reach or exceed the institutional **75%** compliance threshold.

### 6. ⚡ Campus AI Copilot & Command Palette
- **Global Command Palette (`Ctrl + K` / `Cmd + K`):** Quick jump navigation across departments, courses, student records, and settings.
- **Campus AI Copilot (`Ctrl + J` / `Cmd + J`):** Real-time academic assistant for institutional guidelines, course policies, and queries.

## 📊 Database Schema (12 Relational Tables)

1. `users` – Authentication identities, bcrypt hashed passwords, and roles (`ADMIN`, `DEPARTMENT_STAFF`, `FACULTY`, `STUDENT`).
2. `departments` – Academic divisions (CSE, ECE, MECH, MBA) with assigned HOD reference.
3. `academic_years` – Annual academic sessions (e.g., `2025-2026`).
4. `faculty` – Faculty profiles, employee numbers, and designations.
5. `students` – Student admissions, registration numbers, and current semester.
6. `courses` – Academic curriculum catalog with credit weighting (1-10) and semester levels.
7. `course_assignments` – Faculty instructional assignments per academic year and section.
8. `enrollments` – Student registration in specific course assignments.
9. `attendance_sessions` – Conducted lectures with date, period (1-8), topic, `session_pin`, and `pin_expires_at`.
10. `attendance_records` – Per-student session status (`PRESENT`, `ABSENT`, `ON_DUTY`, `LATE`) and audit remarks.
11. `notices` – Institutional and departmental circulars with audience targeting and expiration dates.
12. `audit_logs` – Immutable audit trail recording administrative modifications with JSON diffs.

## 📐 Attendance & On-Duty (OD) Formula

In accordance with institutional accreditation standards, approved On-Duty sessions count as **Present**:

$$\text{Attendance \%} = \left( \frac{\text{Sessions Marked Present} + \text{Sessions Marked On-Duty}}{\text{Total Sessions Conducted}} \right) \times 100$$

- **Compliant (≥ 75%):** Eligible for end-semester examinations without penalty.
- **Deficient (< 75%):** Triggers visual warning banners and requires departmental condonation.

## Mobile App (Android)
Capacitor wrapper of the team's React client, with HashRouter and mobile-specific changes.

- **Stack:** React (client), Node/Express (API), PostgreSQL on Neon, Capacitor (Android)
- **Live API:** https://college-api-ljqv.onrender.com/api/v1
- **Demo login:** student.alex@college.edu / Password@123
- **APK:** link to your GitHub Release

### Build
1. `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
2. `cd ../mobile && npm install && npx cap sync`
3. `npx cap open android`, then Build > Generate App Bundles or APKs > Generate APKs

Original team project credited to the source repository.
## Mobile App (Android)

**Stack:** Capacitor Android app wrapping the React (Vite) client, talking to an Express API on Render with a PostgreSQL database on Neon.

**Live API:** https://college-api-ljqv.onrender.com/api/v1/health

**Demo login:** `student.alex@college.edu` / `Password@123`

**APK:** download `app-debug.apk` from the [v1.0 release](../../releases).

### What I built (mobile)
- Capacitor Android app, packaged as an APK.
- Mobile layout below 1024px: the sidebar is replaced by a fixed bottom navigation bar (Dashboard, Attendance, Courses, Notices, Profile) that keeps the existing role-based access.
- Safe-area padding for the status bar, notch and home indicator, plus 44px minimum touch targets.
- Cold-start handling: if login fails with a network error, the app shows "Server is waking up, please wait up to 60 seconds" with a Retry button.

The web app and the API are the shared team project.

### Build steps
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
cd ../mobile
npx cap sync
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
Building the APK requires **JDK 21**. The APK is created at `mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### Note on hosting
Render's free tier sleeps when idle, so an external uptime monitor pings the public `/api/v1/health` endpoint every 5 minutes. It is not part of the application.
